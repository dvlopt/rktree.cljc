(ns dvlopt.rktree

  "A ranktree is composed of arbitrary subtrees (regular nested maps) that are prioritized by arbitrarily nested sorted maps.
  
   In other words, each leaf is identified first by a vector of ranks (keys of the sorted maps) which provides ordering and then
   by a path which provides a location. Yet in other words, those are sorted trees which have unsorted trees as leaves.

   A lower rank means a higher priority, 0 being thus the highest priority.

   For instance:

   ```clojure
   (def rtree
        (sorted-map 0 (sorted-map 1 {:a {:b 42}})
                    5 {:c {:d {:e 24}}}))

   (= 42
      (ranktree/get rtree
                    [0 1]
                    [:a :b]))

   (= (ranktree/pop rtree)
      [(sorted-map 5 {:c {:d {:e 24}}})
       [0 1]
       {:a {:b 42}}])

   ;; => Ordering is respected, we have popped the [:a :b] leaf with ranks [0 1] and left the rest intact
   ```

   A ranktree must start with at least one sorted map.

   The magic is that is it perfectly normal to mix rank vectors of various length. The functions in this namespace automatically
   treat missing ranks as 0 and know how to be smart about it.

   ```Clojure
   (def rtree-2
        (ranktree/assoc rtree
                        [0 1 0 0 0 5]
                        [:possible?]
                        true))

   (= 42
      ;; The [:a :b] leaf has been re-prioritized from [0 1] to [0 1 0 0 0 0]
      (ranktree/get tree-2
                    [0 1 0 0 0 0]
                    [:a :b])
      ;; But is still accessible with the ranks we used when inserting it earlier
      (ranktree/get tree-2
                    [0 1]
                    [:a :b]))
   ```"
